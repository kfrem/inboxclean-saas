## COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### 1. Free Tier Maximization
```
Strategy: Stay on free tier as long as possible

Action: Use Vercel free + Supabase free tier
Savings: £150-200/month
Limitation: 500MB database, 100GB bandwidth

  - Cache frequent queries
  - Archive old data
```

### 3. Smart Caching
```
Strategy: Cache cleanup results
Estimated Savings: 15-25%
Action:
  - Cache email lists for 1 hour
  - Cache user stats for 5 minutes
  - Pre-compute expensive queries
```

### 4. Batch Email Processing
```
Strategy: Send emails in batches instead of individually
Estimated Savings: 30-50%
Action:
  - Batch notification emails
  - Use email service bulk API
  - Schedule off-peak times
```

### 5. Open Source Tools
```
Strategy: Replace paid tools with free alternatives
Examples:
  - Sentry → Axiom (free tier better)
  - Figma → Penpot (open source)

## FINANCIAL METRICS & RATIOS

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Formula:** Marketing Spend / New Customers

**Startup Phase:**
- Assumption: Bootstrap with no marketing budget
- CAC: £0 (organic growth only)
- Reality: Time + effort (not cash)

**Growth Phase:**
- Assumption: £500/month marketing budget
- Target: 20 new Pro customers/month
- CAC: £25 per new customer

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Formula:** Average Revenue Per User × Average Customer Lifetime

**Calculation:**
```
ARPU: £9.99/month (Pro tier)
Average lifetime: 24 months (estimated)
Churn: 5% monthly

LTV = £9.99 × (1 / 0.05) = £199.80
```

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Formula:** LTV / CAC

```
LTV: £199.80
CAC: £25
Ratio: 8:1 ✓ (Excellent - healthy is 3:1+)
```

### Payback Period

**Formula:** CAC / Monthly Contribution Margin

```
CAC: £25
Monthly contribution: £9.99 - £1 (cost) = £8.99
Payback: 25 / 8.99 = 2.8 months ✓ (Excellent)
```
